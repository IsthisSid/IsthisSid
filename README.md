# HiðŸ‘‹. This is Sid. :blush: 
## I love to learn and learn to love coding.
### My Background
 
- I have been a pharmacist for 10+ years.
- I consider myself a software developer for 1+ year (self-directed learning while working in pharmacy full-time).
- My current interest is in C#, but I enjoy building cross-platform applications in multiple languages.
- I have projects using Swift, React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br>

- I enjoy gaming, so naturally, I built a couple.  
- Try my snowboarding game: [Sid is Snowboarding](https://www.isthissid.com/post/snowboarding-game)
- I welcome challenges and aim to be the best version of myself.
